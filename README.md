# New-York-City-Taxi-Fare-Prediction

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction

__Data File descriptions__\
1)train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows).\
2)test.csv - Input features for the test set (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row.\
3)sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format (columns key and fare_amount). This file 'predicts' fare_amount to be $11.35 for all rows, which is the mean fare_amount from the training set.

We'll train a machine learning model to predict the fare for a taxi ride in New York city given information like pickup date & time, pickup location, drop location and no. of passengers.

Here's an outline of the project:

1)Download the dataset\
2)Explore & analyze the dataset\
3)Prepare the dataset for ML training\
4)Train hardcoded & baseline models\
5)Make predictions & submit to Kaggle\
6)Peform feature engineering\
7)Train & evaluate different models\
8)Tune hyperparameters for the best models\
9)Train on a GPU with the entire dataset\
10)Document & publish the project online
